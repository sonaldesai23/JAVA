# 💻 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository is my personal learning journal as I explore **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java** from scratch.  
I'm learning from the [Java + DSA + Interview Preparation Course by @kunal-kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) and coding each concept and problem daily.
